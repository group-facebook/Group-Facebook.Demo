# Group-Facebook.Demo
Demo Group Facebook apps

Serverless Store is a Google-provided web e-commerce demo app where users
can list, browse and purchase items. It is designed to showcase serverless
solutions on Google Cloud Platform, including
[Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/),
[Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/),
[Google Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/) and many more.

**Serverless Store is not an official Google product.**

The project features:

* Fully Serverless Architecture

    The Serverless Store demo is built completely on Google-managed
    services, from app deployment to the database backend. It scales
    automatically, requires no server management at all, and costs only when
    you use it.

* Event-Driven Design:

    Many workloads in the Serverless Store demo are triggered by events, such
    as user actions (e.g. submitting an order) and system notifications,
    delivered via Cloud Pub/Sub. This design makes workflow automation easier
    than ever, and enables auto-entry, persistent logging, and many more
    features in the app.
